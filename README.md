# Challenges and Opportunities in Municipal Disaster Risk Management: A Mixed-Methods Case Study of Nanumba North Municipal Assembly, Ghana



A mixed-methods investigation into why national disaster policies are poorly implemented at the municipal level in a high-risk district in Northern Ghana, combining in-depth qualitative interviews/focus groups (NADMO staff, fire service, chiefs, assembly members) with a quantitative community survey (n = 40).

## Project Description
This study examines the gap between Ghana’s national disaster management policies and their local implementation in Nanumba North Municipal Assembly – a district prone to windstorms, bushfires and flooding. Using thematic analysis of 11 key informant interviews and focus groups plus a structured survey of 40 residents, the research identifies operational, financial, institutional and political barriers while highlighting practical, context-specific opportunities for improvement.

## Research Questions
- What are the main barriers to effective municipal-level implementation of national disaster policies?
- How do resource constraints, coordination issues and political factors affect disaster preparedness and response?
- What low-cost, high-impact opportunities exist to strengthen local disaster risk reduction?

## Dataset
- **Qualitative**: 11 transcripts from NADMO staff FGD, Planning Unit FGD, Environmental Health & Fire Service KIIs, and traditional leaders/assembly members
- **Quantitative**: Structured survey of 40 community members (demographics, disaster experience, Likert perceptions of NADMO performance, coordination, readiness, training and political interference)
- No personally identifiable information included

## Methods Used
- Qualitative: Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke) – open coding - focused codes - five core themes
- Quantitative:
  - Descriptive statistics & Chi-square tests
  - Spearman correlations
  - Ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds models)
  - Text analysis of open-ended recommendations
- All analysis performed in R Markdown

## Key Findings
- Five interlocking barriers dominate: (1) severe operational resource shortages (vehicles, PPE, hydrants, stocked relief), (2) chronic funding delays/bureaucratic bottlenecks, (3) uneven institutional coordination, (4) perceptions of politicised relief distribution eroding trust, and (5) limited training and centralised authority
- Community social capital and local knowledge are under-utilised strengths
- Quantitative survey confirms widespread perception of inadequate readiness, logistics and training; higher education linked to greater disaster experience reporting
- Practical recommendations emphasise low-cost prevention: intensified radio sensitisation, pre-stocked municipal relief, tree planting, decentralised contingency funds, and empowered physical planning
